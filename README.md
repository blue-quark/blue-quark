## 🚀 About Me

I'm a PhD researcher in biochemistry/structural biology with experience in cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) image and video data processing. I'm currently using this experience to teach myself data science and applying my skills to various coding projects.

## 👨‍🎓 Education

Masters in Chemistry
Bachelors in Chemistry and Biology

## 💼 Professional Experience

I have five years of experience as a PhD researcher, where I spent two years working daily in the field of cryo-EM, using both image and video datasets to calculate maps of large, dynamic proteins. In this role, I worked extensively with scientific computing on Linux computing clusters and servers, and was also responsible for system administration. I regularly used RELION for image and video processing, as well as Bash scripting, Vim, and basic Python programming to manipulate large datasets. I managed large datasets stored on a 128TB Linux server, as well as backups. I'm experienced with numerous structural biology 3D modeling and visualization softwares, such as Coot, Chimera, and ChimeraX.

# 📊 Publications
1. [Current limits of structural biology: The transient interaction between cytochrome c6 and photosystem I](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2665928X20300179)
   - Published in Current Research in Structural Biology
   - Co-authored with A. Koelsch, C. Radon, M. Golub, J. Bürger, T. Mielke, F. Lisdat, A. Feoktystov, J. Pieper, A. Zouni
   - Summary: Trimeric photosystem I from the cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus (TePSI) is an intrinsic membrane protein, which converts solar energy into electrical energy by oxidizing the soluble redox mediator cytochrome c6 (Cyt c6) and reducing ferredoxin. Here, we use cryo-electron microscopy and small angle neutron scattering (SANS) to characterize the transient binding of Cyt c6 to TePSI. The structure of TePSI cross-linked to Cyt c6 was solved at a resolution of 2.9 Å and shows additional cofactors as well as side chain density for 84% of the peptide chain of subunit PsaK, revealing a hydrophobic, membrane intrinsic loop that enables binding of associated proteins. Due to the poor binding specificity, Cyt c 6 could not be localized with certainty in our cryo-EM analysis. SANS measurements confirm that Cyt c6 does not bind to TePSI at protein concentrations comparable to those for cross-linking. However, SANS data indicate a complex formation between TePSI and the non-native mitochondrial cytochrome from horse heart (Cyt cHH). Our study pinpoints the difficulty of identifying very small binding partners (less than 5% of the overall size) in EM structures when binding affinities are poor. We relate our results to well resolved co-structures with known binding affinities and recommend confirmatory methods for complexes with KM values higher than 20 μM.
2. [Atomic Resolution X-Ray Crystal Structure of HIV-1 Protease in Complex with Atazanavir](https://scholarworks.gsu.edu/chemistry_theses/117/)
   - Published in Journal of Chemistry Theses
   - Primary Author
   - Summary: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a pandemic that has infected nearly 1% of the world population. Despite numerous FDA approved antiviral drugs, HIV drug resistance remains a large challenge. HIV protease is an enzyme that is required by the virus to cleave Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins into functional and structural proteins necessary for viral maturation. Currently, nine clinical inhibitors target HIV protease, but multiple clinical viral strains have developed resistance to these drugs. Therefore, it is necessary to continue developing new drugs to tackle the problem of HIV drug resistance, and X-ray crystallography is one tool that is used to study how drug candidates bind to HIV-1 protease. In order to study the interactions between inhibitor atazanavir and HIV-1 protease, the crystal structure of the complex has been solved at atomic resolution (1.09 Å). This structure will improve the design of new inhibitors for resistant protease.
