## 🚀 About Me

I'm a PhD researcher in biochemistry/structural biology with experience in cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) image and video data processing. I'm currently using this experience to teach myself data science and applying my skills to various coding projects.

## 👨‍🎓 Education

    Masters in Chemistry
    Bachelors in Chemistry and Biology

## 💼 Professional Experience

I have five years of experience as a PhD researcher, where I spent two years working daily in the field of cryo-EM, using both image and video datasets to calculate maps of large, dynamic proteins. In this role, I worked extensively with scientific computing on Linux computing clusters and servers, and was also responsible for system administration. I regularly used RELION for image and video processing, as well as Bash scripting, Vim, and basic Python programming to manipulate large datasets. I managed large datasets stored on a 128TB Linux server, as well as backups. I'm experienced with numerous structural biology 3D modeling and visualization softwares, such as Coot, Chimera, and ChimeraX.
